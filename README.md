it will ask you for the server address and port, make sure to use it without tcp://
then paste the server password.

it will then ask you for a nickname and the fernet key

for the nickname you can use any name/alias that you want to go by in that chat

for the fernet key, make sure to copy and paste it from the server and inclue the "=" in the end example "uwvOTbNmHofe1vA41Qlox3lbNgL0qFlFyhaAAAaSi6o="

and now you are ready to chat with your friends, just give them the credentials from the server but make sure to send it to them in a secure manner.

Enjoy chatting ðŸ˜Š
